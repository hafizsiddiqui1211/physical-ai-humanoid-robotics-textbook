# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Implementation

## PROMPT_TEXT
Create a comprehensive Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook using Docusaurus as specified in the feature requirements. The textbook should include all content sections, be properly configured for GitHub Pages deployment, and follow the project constitution principles.

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Successfully implemented the complete Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook using Docusaurus. Created all required content sections including foundations, systems, simulation, AI & perception, humanoid robotics, vision-language-action, and capstone project. The textbook covers essential topics from Physical AI and embodied intelligence to advanced concepts like Vision-Language-Action systems and simulation-to-real transfer. All content was created with technical accuracy and pedagogical clarity, following the project constitution principles. The Docusaurus configuration is complete with proper navigation, deployment settings, and static assets. The site builds successfully and is ready for GitHub Pages deployment.
